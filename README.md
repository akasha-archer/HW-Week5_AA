# HW-Week5_AA

 REFACTORED CODE:
 1.  I created a separate class for the methods and structure of game. I used the Main class solely for the purpose of starting the game.
 2.  I corrected the loop that checked if the user entered a valid number for the country selection.
 3.  I included a playAgain variable that allowed the user to play another round of the game immediately after finishing.
